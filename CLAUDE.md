# Farey NOW — Math Research Project

This is a **mathematics research project** (Farey sequences, primes-equispaced, Koyama replication, formal conjectures). Lean4 is used for formalization.

Token Economy (`./te`, `token-economy.yaml`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `adapters/`) is **tooling only** — a local framework for context/cost management. It is not the subject of the work.

Read `start.md` for boot sequence and retrieval rules. Keep this file tiny.

## Brainer skills

Skill bodies under `skills/<name>/` lazy-load on trigger. Catalog index: [`skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md`](skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md).

## Repo-local trigger skills (resident at boot)

Skill bodies under `skills/<name>/` lazy-load on trigger. The names + 1-line
descriptions below are kept in this resident doc so a freshly booted (or
post-compaction) agent still knows what's available — so a model-invokable
trigger (e.g. `wiki-memory` for "have we done X") is recognised on sight
rather than re-derived from scratch.

### Slash-triggered (user types literally; model cannot auto-invoke)

These are literal text tokens you recognise yourself — NOT host-registered
commands. When the user's message starts with one of these tokens, load
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and follow it yourself, even if this host has no such
command installed (e.g. Codex, Antigravity) or shows an "unknown command"
error. Treat the rest of the message as the task. Don't improvise a hand-rolled
equivalent:

- `/think` — How an agent should think and approach problems — first-principles, reduce/simplify before adding, research-and-borrow before building, experiment-and-falsify, never hallucinate or flatter

### Model-invokable (host fires on matching context)

You don't need to dispatch these manually — but knowing they exist helps you
notice when context matches one (e.g. `wiki-memory` for "have we done X").

- `cache-lint` — Audit a Claude Code project for prompt-cache hygiene against Anthropic's six cache rules (ordering, dynamic-content injection, tool stability, model switching, breakpoint sizing, fork safety)
- `caveman-ultra` — Terse output style
- `compliance-canary` — UserPromptSubmit hook that scans recent assistant messages for per-skill drift signals (filler phrases, word-count creep, "done"-without-verification, custom regex)
- `context-keeper` — PreCompact hook that extracts structured state (files, commands, errors, numbers, decisions, failures) from the transcript before compaction
- `index-first` — Prefer pre-built indexes over chains of grep/read/scan
- `lean-execution` — Prune plans, process, context, and delegation to the smallest safe path
- `output-filter` — Use when terminal output is noisy with ANSI / progress bars / duplicate lines and you want to keep the agent's eyes on signal
- `plan-first-execute` — Plan before executing non-trivial tasks
- `prompt-triage` — Use on every UserPromptSubmit (pre-model hook) to classify the prompt and emit a directive telling the main model which subagent/model should handle it
- `semantic-diff` — AST-node-level diff for file re-reads
- `skill-pulse` — UserPromptSubmit hook that periodically re-injects active skill rules to fight instruction drift
- `verify-before-completion` — Use before claiming work is done, fixed, passing, committed, or ready
- `wiki-memory` — Repo-local markdown wiki with progressive retrieval (search → timeline → fetch) and gated writes (verified facts only)
- `wiki-refresh` — Reconcile wiki-memory pages against the current codebase — Keep / Update / Consolidate / Replace / Delete drifted ones
- `write-gate` — Decide whether a candidate fact deserves persistent memory

### Durable memory store (repo-local wiki)

This repo carries a curated knowledge store addressed by the tiered index at
`L1_index.md` (root) and queried through the `./te wiki` surface — the
*why/decision/failure-lesson* layer (rationale, trade-offs, incidents,
procedures), distinct from auto-extracted code structure. Relevant when the task
references past work, prior decisions, or "have we done X". Query it before
re-deriving: read `L1_index.md` first, then `./te wiki search "<q>"` →
`./te wiki timeline "<id>"` → `./te wiki fetch "<id>"`. The `wiki-memory` (write)
and `wiki-refresh` (reconcile vs code) skills cover the same store.
