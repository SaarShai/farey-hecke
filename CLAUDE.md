# Farey NOW — Math Research Project

This is a **mathematics research project** (Farey sequences, primes-equispaced, Koyama replication, formal conjectures). Lean4 is used for formalization.

Token Economy (`./te`, `token-economy.yaml`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `adapters/`) is **tooling only** — a local framework for context/cost management. It is not the subject of the work.

Read `start.md` for boot sequence and retrieval rules. Keep this file tiny.

## Brainer skills

Skill bodies under `skills/<name>/` lazy-load on trigger. Catalog index: [`skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md`](skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md).

<!-- brainer:skills-catalog:start -->
## Repo-local trigger skills (resident at boot)

Skill bodies under `skills/<name>/` lazy-load on trigger; the 1-line
descriptions below stay resident so a freshly booted (or post-compaction)
agent still recognises a trigger on sight instead of re-deriving it.

### Slash-triggered (user types literally; model cannot auto-invoke)

Literal tokens you recognise yourself — NOT host-registered commands. If the
user's message starts with one, load `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and follow it
yourself even if this host has no such command (e.g. Codex, Antigravity) or
shows "unknown command". Treat the rest of the message as the task; don't
improvise a hand-rolled equivalent:

- `/baton` — Drop/grab a verified session-handoff file — pass in-progress work to the next agent (future session, another window, codex) via .brainer/baton/
- `/brainer-audit` — Use when the user explicitly activates Brainer audit mode, asks to audit this session, audit Brainer use, or track Brainer skill usage
- `/brainer` — Use when the user explicitly says `/brainer` or asks to use any relevant Brainer skill: inspect the optional-method reference, select the smallest task-relevant set, and apply only exported methods or complete skill contracts as declared
- `/caveman-ultra` — Experimental/manual terse-output style retained for paired evaluation
- `/fable-mode` — Experimental/manual five-gate work discipline retained for paired evaluation
- `/lean-execution` — Experimental/manual lean-work protocol retained for paired evaluation
- `/learn-skill` — Experimental/manual skill-learning workflow retained for paired evaluation
- `/loop-engineering` — Experimental/manual loop-design workflow retained for paired evaluation
- `/plan-first-execute` — Experimental/manual planning protocol retained for paired evaluation
- `/prompt-triage` — Experimental manual router for paired evaluation
- `/requirements-ledger` — Experimental/manual visible requirements-ledger workflow retained for paired evaluation
- `/self-improvement-loops` — Govern loops that optimize their own agent machinery.
- `/standing-orders` — Experimental standing-directive probes retained for shadow telemetry and paired evaluation
- `/task-retrospective` — Use only when the user explicitly arms task audit mode: /retro, asks for task-retrospective, says this task will repeat and should be learned from, or requests an after-the-fact task learning audit
- `/team-lead` — Experimental/manual orchestration protocol retained for paired evaluation
- `/think` — How an agent should think and approach problems — first-principles, reduce/simplify before adding, research-and-borrow before building, experiment-and-falsify, never hallucinate or flatter
- `/verify-before-completion` — Experimental/manual FULL verification workflow retained for paired evaluation
- `/wayfinder` — Experimental/manual decision-recovery workflow retained for paired evaluation

### Model-invokable (host fires on matching context)

No manual dispatch needed — but knowing these exist helps you notice a
context match (e.g. `wiki-memory` for "have we done X").

- `cache-lint` — Audit a Claude Code project for prompt-cache hygiene against Anthropic's six cache rules (ordering, dynamic-content injection, tool stability, model switching, breakpoint sizing, fork safety), plus a rule-7 tool-surface audit (resident-but-unused MCP servers)
- `compliance-canary` — Use when a long session may drift or needs verification-compliance monitoring
- `context-keeper` — PreCompact hook that extracts structured state (files, commands, errors, numbers, decisions, failures) from the transcript before compaction, so the summarizer can't silently drop facts; a SessionEnd hook also archives the raw transcript to .brainer/sessions/raw/ (git-ignored), and a SessionStart/PreCompact staleness sweep catches sessions on hosts (e.g
- `eval-gate` — Score AI output against a written rubric before it ships — an LLM-as-judge quality gate for content output (drafts, posts, answers) and product output (an agent's reply, an extraction, a generated payload)
- `impact-of-change` — Use before committing or claiming work done to map a code edit to its blast radius — which symbols depend on the changed ones, plus a LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/UNKNOWN risk score
- `index-first` — Prefer pre-built indexes over chains of grep/read/scan
- `output-filter` — Use when terminal output is noisy with ANSI / progress bars / duplicate lines and you want to keep the agent's eyes on signal
- `propagate` — Use when the user asks to propagate, sync, roll out, or push Brainer skill changes to the sibling/consumer repos (screenery-lean, product images repo, farey-hecke, PROMPTER, …) after work in the canonical Brainer repo, or asks to harvest lessons, reap lessons, or bring learnings back from a sibling
- `security-oversight` — Use before committing or claiming work done to triage a code edit for INTRODUCED security risk — leaked secrets, dangerous sinks, untrusted deps, risky auth logic
- `semantic-diff` — AST-node-level diff for file re-reads
- `wiki-memory` — Repo-local markdown wiki with progressive retrieval (search → timeline → fetch) and gated writes (verified facts only)
- `wiki-refresh` — Reconcile wiki-memory pages against the current codebase — Keep / Update / Consolidate / Replace / Delete drifted ones
- `write-gate` — Decide whether a candidate fact deserves persistent memory

### Durable memory store (`wiki/`)

Curated why/decision/failure-lesson layer at `wiki/`. Query before re-deriving
(e.g. "have we done X"): read `wiki/L1_index.md`, then
`python3 skills/wiki-memory/tools/wiki.py search "<q>"` → `timeline` → `fetch`.
Maintained by `wiki-memory` (write) / `wiki-refresh` (reconcile vs code).

### Code-craft directives (resident at boot)

Always-on rules for writing code — they apply on every coding turn, not only when
a skill happens to trigger:

- **Surgical diffs.** Smallest reversible change, touching only what the ask
  needs, matched to local style. Leave untouched code byte-identical — a
  changed line exists only because the task required it. (The
  `whitespace_only_edit` + `dependency-manifest-changed` `compliance-canary`
  probes enforce it mechanically.)
- **Failure-mode interrupt.** Catch mid-task drift by name — scope-creep is
  Kitchen Sink, an abstraction before the 3rd repeat skips rule of three, an
  ignored error path is happy-path-only, a cascading fix is Runaway Refactor,
  rebuilding what a tool provides is Reinvented Wheel (borrow-check first) —
  then pause, restate the goal, and narrow scope.
- **Borrow first.** Name the existing tool checked and why it falls short
  before building machinery; a brief missing that is malformed. Deep: `/think`.
- **Frontier ownership.** Top-tier agents own the end-to-end goal and hard
  judgment. Run independent, gated work concurrently on the cheapest reliable
  lanes; retain direct work only when no suitable lane is reachable or the
  explicit ~<30-line judgment-dense exception applies.
  Continue, correct, synthesize, and verify until done; stop only for missing
  authority or a real blocker. Full contract: `skills/_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md`
  §6.
- **Task routing.** Before root/child mutation, receipt: artifacts,
  SPEC'D/GATED, size, authority, route, owner, exception. Project/AGENTS.md
  authority beats generic default; required routes hold regardless of speed.
  Delegate SPEC'D+GATED >~30-line work; frontier owns unresolved diagnosis.
  Late receipt: pause, re-route the rest, cold-review early edits.

### Host capability matrix (honest degradation)

Host capability & degradation matrix (claude/codex/gemini): see
`docs/HOST_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` — the RULE still binds on a host lacking a
hook; enforce it manually.
